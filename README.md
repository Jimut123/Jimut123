I am a 1<sup>st</sup> year Ph.D. Student in <a href="https://www.minds.iitb.ac.in/index.php/people/students/phd-students" target="_blank"> C-MInDS </a> at **IIT Bombay** and advised by <a id="bold_id" href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~suyash/index.html" target="_blank"> Professor Suyash P. Awate</a>. I have completed my postgraduation from <a href="http://cs.rkmvu.ac.in/" target="_blank" > Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Educational  and Research Institute </a> where I pursued M. Sc. in Computer Science. I have completed my undergraduate studies at <a href="https://www.sxccal.edu/" target="_blank" > St. Xavier's College, Kolkata</a>. 

My research interest lies in **Deep Learning and Computer Vision in medical settings** where I have <a href="https://jimut123.github.io/publications.html" target="_blank"> published a few works </a>. I am also interested in other fields of deep learning such as **semi-supervised learning, explainable AI and unsupervised learning**.  I am fortunate to be mentored by fantastic researchers and engineers during my undergraduate and postgraduate studies. During my postgraduation I have been mentored by <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~tamaltan/welcome/welcome.html" target="_blank" id="bold_id" alt="Tamal's Buffalo Website" > Tamal </a> <a href="http://cs.rkmvu.ac.in/~tamal/"  target="_blank" id="bold_id" alt="Tamal's Buffalo Website"> Maharaj </a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200624004219/http://www2.eng.ox.ac.uk/civil/efm/people/dripta-sarkar" target="_blank" id="bold_id" alt="Dripta's oxford Website" >  Dripta Mj </a> and did several projects in Computer Vision and Deep Learning under their supervision. I am blessed to attend courses offered by <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/dora/profile/Prof-Shreesh-Jadhav" target="_blank" id="bold_id" alt="Sarvo is god" > Shreesh </a> <a href="http://cs.rkmvu.ac.in/~shreesh/" target="_blank" id="bold_id" alt="Sarvo"> Maharaj</a> and <a href="http://cs.rkmvu.ac.in/~swat/" id="bold_id" target="_blank" alt="swat"> Swathy Prabhu Mj</a> in RKMVERI. In the past, I have been supervised by <a href="https://www.sxccal.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ShalabhAgarwal.pdf" id="bold_id" target="_blank"> Prof. Shalabh Agarwal (former HOD of CS, St. Xavier's College)</a>. 

If you want to collaborate/have questions, send me an email (Note: I may be slow to respond).
<a href="https://jimut123.github.io/blogs/JBP_Scripts.html" alt="JBP Scripts" target="_blank" id="bold_id" > Here </a> are a set of PDFs and notes. 
I wrote most of them during my stay at RKMVERI. I also write <a href="https://jimut123.github.io/blog.html" target="_blank"> blogs </a> in my leisure time. I used to dabble on different <a href="https://jimut123.github.io/projects.html" target="_blank"> projects <a> during my undergraduate studies.
